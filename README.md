## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Micaela, a Data Scientist with an analytical approach that combines my background in Law with my skills in Python, SQL and Machine Learning.

I work as a freelancer, helping to solve problems and optimize processes through data.

I am still honing my programming skills and am always looking to improve and learn something new.

I enjoy nature, traveling and volunteering, I have had the opportunity to collaborate in several social and environmental projects in Venezuela and Ecuador.

I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to keep growing!
